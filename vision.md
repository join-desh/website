        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <h2>Software-Defined Democracy for India</h2>
        <p>Imagine a government that operates with the efficiency of well-architected software, the transparency of open-source projects, and the expertise of domain specialists.</p>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>🏛️ Government as Code</h3>
            <p>All policies, decisions, and processes are codified, version-controlled, and auditable. Citizens can track every change, understand the reasoning, and contribute to improvements through a transparent democratic process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>🎯 Evidence-Based Governance</h3>
            <p>Decisions are made based on data, research, and measurable outcomes rather than political rhetoric. Every policy comes with success metrics, testing phases, and rollback mechanisms if targets aren't met.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>🔬 Domain Expert Leadership</h3>
            <p>Aviation policy is made by aviation experts, healthcare policy by healthcare professionals, and cybersecurity frameworks by cybersecurity specialists. No more generalist politicians making uninformed decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>🌐 Distributed Democracy</h3>
            <p>Like distributed systems, governance is decentralized with local autonomy, fault tolerance, and scalable decision-making processes that work from village level to national policy.</p>

                <p>Citizens can monitor government performance in real-time: budget utilization, policy implementation progress, outcome metrics, and resource allocation - all transparent and accessible.</p>

                <h3>🔄 Continuous Integration for Policy</h3>
                <div class="blog-meta">$ git merge feature/healthcare-reform</div>
                <p>New policies go through automated testing, peer review by experts, public consultation, and pilot programs before being deployed. Failed policies are quickly identified and rolled back.</p>
