        <h1>About DESH</h1>
        <h2>Democratically Elected System Hackers</h2>
        <p>We are the world's first software-defined political party, applying engineering principles to governance and democracy.</p>

            <h3>üéØ Our Mission</h3>
            <p>To replace career politicians with domain experts who actually understand the systems they're governing. We believe India needs aviation experts running aviation policy, not politicians making uninformed decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>üîß Our Approach</h3>
            <p>We apply software engineering principles to politics: version control for policies, peer review for legislation, continuous integration for governance, and transparent, auditable decision-making processes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>üë• Our Team</h3>
            <p>100 founding members who are experts across critical domains - from aviation and software to military and healthcare. Each member brings real-world experience solving complex problems in their field.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>üåç Our Vision</h3>
            <p>A technocratic democracy where decisions are made based on evidence, expertise, and measurable outcomes rather than political rhetoric and electoral calculations.</p>
        </div>

    <section class="blog">
        <h2>Why Software-Defined Politics?</h2>
        <div class="blog-intro">
            <p>Traditional politics operates like legacy code - functional but inefficient, opaque, and prone to corruption bugs. We're building Democracy 2.0 with modern engineering practices.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="blog-posts">
            <article class="blog-post">
                <h3>üîç Transparent by Design</h3>
                <p>Every decision, vote, and policy change is tracked immutably. Our governance algorithms are open-source and auditable by anyone. No more black-box politics.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="blog-post">
                <h3>‚ö° Rapid Iteration</h3>
                <p>Like software development, we believe in rapid prototyping, testing, and iteration. Pilot programs, A/B testing for policies, and continuous improvement based on real-world data.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="blog-post">
                <h3>ü§ù Collaborative Development</h3>
                <p>Politics should be collaborative like open-source projects. Pull requests for policy changes, peer review by domain experts, and community-driven development of solutions.</p>

        <h2>Join the System Hackers</h2>
        <p>Are you a domain expert tired of watching politicians make uninformed decisions in your field?</p>
        <p>We're building a movement of system hackers who want to debug democracy and implement evidence-based governance.</p>
